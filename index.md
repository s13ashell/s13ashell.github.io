I'm a research engineer in Huawei TCS Lab. My research interests lie in resource allocation, decision tree complexity, combinatorial algorithm and quantum computing. I finished my Ph.D on Jan. 2022, under the supervising of prof. Xiaoming Sun. Before that, I received my bachelor's degree from Sichuan University in 2016.
